# SnakeV2JavaFx

Hello this is my second time writing snake game. This time instead of using Java Swing library I`m using Java Fx. So main idea in my code that I using GridPane to make my Scene (JavaFx) or Jpanel (Swing) in to equal small pieces and put a label inside every section and set all labels have red background color

after that I created cordinate class where I stored each seperated Snake cordinate I use arraylist to save snake cordinates.    long story short my snake pretty much is just labels constanly changing background color
